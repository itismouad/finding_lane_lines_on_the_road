# Find Lane Lines on the Road

This project uses color selection, image masking, canny edge detection, hough transform, and lane line averaging to find lane lines from video footage. 

The code for this project is in the [IPython Notebook](finding_lane_lines.ipynb.ipynb) and you can dive into the details of what I did by reading the [write-up](finding_lane_lines.ipynb.md).
